## Objectives

- Work in groups
- Practice Read and Speak skills
- Solidify JavaScript knowledge
- Help cohort learn each other's names

## Whiteboard

1. Each group will get a question, on a print out of the code. 
2. Work through the code on paper and the whiteboard.
3. If needed, you may Google things to research what methods do, but __DO NOT__ run the code on a computer!
4. Transcribe the code onto a white board. What values print at each step along the way?


## Presentation

Each team will present their problem to the rest of the cohort. Each student in the team must verbally walk through at least one step of the problem. At the end of each step they should note the value of the given variable they are tracking.

When all teams are finished presenting, we will run the code to see how well we did. We will check the answers at each step, allowing some time for questions along the way.

Remember, in the end we've all learned something, regardless of if we got all the answers right or wrong.
